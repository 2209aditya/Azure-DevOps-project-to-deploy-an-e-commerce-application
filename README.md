# Azure DevOps Project to Deploy an E-Commerce Application
## Overview
This project automates the deployment of a scalable e-commerce application using Azure DevOps pipelines. It integrates infrastructure provisioning, application build, and deployment into a streamlined CI/CD process.
## Features
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform or ARM templates
- Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to build and test the application
- Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline to deploy the app to Azure App Services or Kubernetes
- Automated testing and quality checks
- Cost and resource optimization in deployment

## Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with necessary permissions
- Azure DevOps organization and project setup
- Terraform CLI or Azure CLI installed locally
- Access to container registry (if using containers)
- Git installed for source control
## Usage
### Setup Infrastructure
```bash
cd infra
terraform init
terraform apply
```
### Build and Deploy via Azure DevOps Pipelines
- Commit and push your code to trigger the CI pipeline (`ci.yml`)
- Upon successful build, CD pipeline (`cd.yml`) deploys the application
### Application Access
After deployment, access the e-commerce application via the Azure App Service URL or Load Balancer IP.
